3. Set screen resolution: 1920×1080
4. Prepare script (see below)

## Demo Script (3-4 minutes)

### Scene 1: Opening (15 sec)
**Narration**: 
> "This is our AI-powered grid optimization system. It uses deep reinforcement learning to reduce electricity costs by over 63% compared to traditional methods."

**Actions**:
- Show full dashboard
- Pause on title

### Scene 2: Key Metrics (30 sec)
**Narration**:
> "At the top, you can see our key performance indicators. We achieved 63.3% cost reduction, with an AI average cost of just $1.5 million per week, compared to $4 million for the baseline."

**Actions**:
- Hover over each stat card
- Let numbers sink in

### Scene 3: Cost Comparison (45 sec)
**Narration**:
> "This chart shows the dramatic cost difference. The green bar is our AI system at $1.48 million. The traditional greedy method costs $4.02 million - that's 2.7 times more expensive. The rule-based approach is even worse at $5.2 million."

**Actions**:
- Scroll to comparison chart
- Hover over each bar
- Emphasize AI (green) vs others

### Scene 4: Dispatch Trajectory (1 min)
**Narration**:
> "Here's where it gets interesting. This shows how the system schedules power generation over 168 hours - one full week. The red line is actual electricity demand, and the green line is our AI's supply."

**Actions**:
- Show trajectory chart
- Point out supply tracking demand

> "Notice how closely the AI follows demand - that's intelligent scheduling. Now let's compare to the traditional greedy method..."

**Actions**:
- Click "Greedy Baseline" radio button
- Wait for chart update

> "See the difference? The blue supply line frequently overshoots demand. That excess capacity costs money - literally burning fuel to generate power nobody needs."

### Scene 5: Cumulative Cost (45 sec)
**Narration**:
> "This cumulative cost chart really drives home the savings. Over the course of one week, the gap between our AI and traditional methods grows dramatically. The green line stays flat - minimal cost. The red and orange lines climb steeply."

**Actions**:
- Scroll to cumulative cost chart
- Follow the lines from left to right

> "By the end of the week, we've saved over $2.5 million for this 1,000 megawatt system."

### Scene 6: Real-World Impact (30 sec)
**Narration**:
> "This isn't a simulation. Every data point you see comes from actual PJM grid operations - 3,507 hours of real-world testing. We trained on 35,000 hours of historical data from the PJM Interconnection, which serves 65 million people."

**Actions**:
- Scroll back to top
- Show full dashboard

> "The system is production-ready and validated on real grid data. Thank you."

## Tips for Great Demo

### Voice
- **Speak clearly**and at moderate pace
- **Pause**after key numbers (63%, $131M)
- **Enthusiasm**but professional tone
- **Practice**script 2-3 times first

### Mouse Movement
- **Slow and deliberate**- no jerky movements
- **Hover meaningfully**- emphasize what you're pointing at
- **Pause**to let viewer absorb charts

### Mistakes
- **Don't restart**for minor errors
- Can edit out pauses in post
- Authentic > perfect

## Alternative: Silent Demo

If you prefer no narration:

1. **Add Text Overlays**:
   - Arrow pointing to each chart
   - Text: "63% Cost Reduction", "$2.5M Saved", etc.

2. **Background Music Only**:
   - Upbeat but professional
   - Royalty-free

3. **Shorter**: 1-2 minutes
   - Show each chart for 10-15 seconds
   - Text explains what it shows

---

## Time Estimates

- **Script practice**: 15 min
- **Recording**: 5-10 min (multiple takes)
- **Basic editing**: 15-30 min
- **Export**: 5 min

**Total**: 45-60 minutes for polished demo

## Where to Share

1. **Pitch Deck**: Embed or link
2. **YouTube**: Unlisted link for investors
3. **Vimeo**: Professional hosting
4. **Loom**: Easy sharing with auto-captions
5. **Website**: Homepage demo
6. **LinkedIn**: Announcement post

---

**Recommendation**: Start with QuickTime screen recording + narration. Simple, fast, professional results.

Good luck!
